# The default layout

This page uses the default layout. This site configures layout: default as a front matter default value for all pages in the docs directory.

The default layout of Just the Docs is a responsive layout: on medium and larger width displays, it displays a sidebar, including a navigation panel; on smaller width displays, the sidebar is automatically hidden under a button.

All pages except top-level pages automatically have a list of so-called breadcrumbs: links to their parent pages and any higher-level ancestors. They show the breadcrumbs above the main content of the page.
